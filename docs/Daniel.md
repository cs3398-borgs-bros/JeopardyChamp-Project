## Daniel - Jeopardy Champ! Project Research and Accomplishments

I have been studying and researching the different tools and languages involved in creating a Dynamic Web application with a main focus in Java. There are many ways to develop a web app, so I have been looking into a structure and tools that can be used by our group that are understandable with the knowledge we already contain.

Our current project contains the following tools and dependencies: Heroku, Apache Maven, Apache Tomcat, and various apache and java plugins for web socket compatibility. The web application also implements Javascript, Java, some Jquery, and JavaServerPages. 

I was able to host our application in Heroku, which also compiles and builds the project as the demo repository is updated (like the Travis-CI tool that was introduced in class). This can be seen on https://jeopardy-champ.herokuapp.com/ . I have also been working with and testing the Java code to see when a Session is created in the logs of the Hamachi server. 

Along with my team members, I will attempt to implement hosting features where users can join the same session that is being hosted.
