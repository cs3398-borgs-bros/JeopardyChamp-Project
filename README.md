To anyone looking to enhance their in class experience and keep students engaged, we have the answer for you! We as team of CS Students understand that it can sometimes be hard for the professor to get their students attention and focus on the lecture material. This is where *Jeopardy Champ!* comes into play! With this tool you will be able to put students head-to-head by solving problems over what was just lectured and/or to ensure they are paying attention all while having fun. The game consists of multiple categories of unknown questions with low and high point value than can be selected by the team of participants in play. We aim to have a variety of features that will be visually appealing and satisfying to our users.

Currently, the project can currently be run/built. However, the current project is unstable and has not been modified to meet the project's goal. Enhancements are still underway.

# Sprint Two Review and Retrospective 4/9/19
Walter: I created the question bank for each statment. This can be found under JeopardyChamp-Project/docs/Question bank or at ( https://github.com/cs3398-borgs-bros/JeopardyChamp-Project/blob/master/docs/Question%20bank.xlsx ), these questions can be seen in the game in the form of buttons for the user to click on. The implementation of these buttons with the question can be seen under JeopardyChamp-Project/src/main/webapp/Game/index.jsp or at ( https://github.com/cs3398-borgs-bros/JeopardyChamp-Project/blob/master/src/main/webapp/Game/index.jsp )

Carter: Did research on how to establish a game lobby to make our webpage dynamic and have multiplayer acess. Tested and implemented the game lobby itself. I modified the JeopardyChamp-Project/src/main/java/com/borgs/websocket/Main.java so the host and join features are added to the socket. My research resources is uploaded and is called GameLobbyResearch.txt. 

# Project status and next steps
Walter: Currently the project is a little behind schedule. My next step would be testing and implementation of multiplayer within the game.

Walter: Finding a way of hosting our application on a website to be reached by any PC/Phone through Heroku. JeopardyChamp-Project/docs/Hosting Java application.docx

Carter: Figuring out how the interface works along with the dynamic webpage, add changes to jsp text to add the CS history and java
questions.

# Project Status/Next Step:
Walter: Next step would be create a "Game Lobby" for users to connect and see the same dynamic page.
