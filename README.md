The Borgs Bros team is creating a game that will be the hottest learning tool on the market so that institutes of higher education can provide a more interactive learning experience that that bridges the gap between students and faculty.

To anyone looking to enhance their in class experience and keep students engaged, we have the answer for you! We as team of CS Students understand that it can sometimes be hard for the professor to get their students attention and focus on the lecture material. This is where *Jeopardy Champ!* comes into play! With this tool you will be able to put students head-to-head by solving problems over what was just lectured and/or to ensure they are paying attention all while having fun. The game consists of multiple categories of unknown questions with low and high point value than can be selected by the team of participants in play. We aim to have a variety of features that will be visually appealing and satisfying to our users.

The project can be viewed in the link above. The project still requires some work for it to be fully functional. Some of the features that need to be implemented include the feature of the voting system to select the correct answer by a team as well as some improvements on the visuals and visibility of the elements in the project.

Daniel: I was able to separate the plugins and add comments to indicate the section's purpose in the game scripts and html to keep the project manageable. I also was able to create a functioning implementation of a websocket interaction with the server, which allowed for the multiplayer interaction with the server.
